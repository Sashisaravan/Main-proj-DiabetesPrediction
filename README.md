# An Improved machine learning algorithm for the Detection of diabetic mellitus in health care segment. 

 This is my Academic Main project in the domain of Machine learning: 

Diabetes mellitus is a disorder brought on by high blood sugar levels. This illness is easily treatable or
preventable if caught early on. According to statistics on global health, both the prevalence of type 2
diabetes and the cost of treatment are rising. There is no cure for this condition. Foreseeing the beginning
of diabetes is a powerful application of machine learning. Several machine learning algorithms have been
created recently, and their sensitivity to predicting diabetes has been examined. The major objective of
this study is to predict the diagnosis of diabetes using a variety of machine learning approaches.
Additionally, these models' predictions are evaluated together with additional performance metrics like
accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC. In order to compare them and decide which one is
the most helpful in this regard, the models were evaluated for loss of function, computing time, and error
rate. Several machine learning techniques, including Random Forest [RF], Naive Bayes [NB], Logistic
Regression [LR], and Support Vector Machine [SVM], were used in the current work. With an accuracy
rate of 82.46%, the data showed that logistic regression (LR) performed better than the other techniques.
Our project's goal is to create machine learning models that are far better and more advanced than the
existing ones. These models will comprise decision trees, K-nearest neighbors, multilayer perceptrons,
and two boosting models, extreme gradient boosting and stochastic gradient boosting. Described
techniques for using machine learning Additionally, enhancing machine learning techniques can deliver
more precise. In addition, we have created a Streamlit application to check the performance and accuracy
of the pre-trained machine learning model.
It also highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate algorithm for a specific task and dataset. Further
research and optimization of the models may be necessary to improve their performance and generalizability for
specific applications. Overall, the evaluation results suggest that machine learning algorithms, particularly
XGBoost, hold promise for improving the accuracy and efficiency of diabetes diagnosis and treatment. It also
emphasizes how crucial it is to choose the right method for a particular task and dataset. It may be essential to
do additional analysis and model optimization in order to enhance the models' functionality and applicability in
particular situations. Overall, the evaluation results point to the possibility of improving the precision and
efficiency of diabetes diagnosis and treatment using machine learning algorithms, particularly XGBoost.
